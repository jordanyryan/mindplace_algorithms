# Algorithms and Data Structures

One of my personal favorite things--compact logical challenges solved with code!

This repo contains some algorithms and data structure models that I've written/solved as part of strengthening my grasp of
CS theory.

A related repo is my [multiple languages repo](https://github.com/mindplace/multiple_languages), where I'm solving
algorithms in different languages to get a sense of how different languages work.
